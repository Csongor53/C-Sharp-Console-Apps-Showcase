# Installation
#### To install and run the flood fill algorithm program, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio or another compatible C# IDE installed on your compute
2. download the source code files.
3. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.

# Running the Program
1. Open the input.txt file in the solution explorer and input the grid you wish to fill, use the letter "s" to mark the starting position.
2. Make sure your terminal in the correct directory.
3. Run the following two commands: dotnet build, and dotnet run.
4. Wait for the program to complete the flood fill algorithm.
5. Once the algorithm is completed, the final state of the grid will be saved in the output.txt file, which will be created in the same directory as the program.

Note: The program will display the current state of the grid in the console during the algorithm's execution.
